 This was more straight forward than I thought prior to starting. It was fun, I used CSS Grid in structuring the main part of the page(Ingredients and instruction, and the duration card on the right.) making it as responsive as possible without so much altering with media queries.

 As in the last challenge, I decided to account for other screen sizes apart from the required mobile phone and laptop views.
